## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In this project, I shall answer the following business questions using Heart Failuure dataset:

- What's the Correlation between heart failure and different aspects?
- What is the smokers' percentage for each gender?
- Can the frequency of follow up times affect the death events?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Attached to this repo a notebook attached where you can find all analysis steps for the business questions we have.
The notebook is easy to navigate and I have added comments and markdown cells to make it even easier for the reader.  


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The analysis and findings of this study can be found in the "blog.md" [here](https://github.com/sfarouk3/P1_Heart-Failure-analysis/blob/main/blog.md).
