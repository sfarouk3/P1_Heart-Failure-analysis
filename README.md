## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In this project, I shall answer the following business questions using Heart Failuure dataset:

- What's the Correlation between heart failure and different aspects?
- What is the smokers' percentage for each gender?
- Can the frequency of follow up times affect the death events?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

I have added 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  it should be easy to navigate through the notebook  from loading the dataset till answering the above questions one by one.
I have also added comments and markdown cells to make it easier to navigate and understand the file.  


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found in the "Blog-HouseSalesAnalysis.md" [here](https://github.com/telayat/House-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/Blog-HouseSalesAnalysis.md) attached to this repo.
